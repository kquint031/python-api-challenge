# python-api-challenge
## Background Overview: 
Two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy to answer the question: What is the weather like near the equator?

"Part 1: WeatherPy: Create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. [Using] the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities."

"Part 2: VacationPy
Use weather data skills to plan future vacations. Use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employ Python skills to create map visualizations."

## Objectives:
* Part 1
  * Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
  * Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship
* Part 2
  * Create a map that displays a point. The size of the point must be in reference to the humidity in each city.
  * Narrow down the DataFrame to find my ideal weather condition.
  * Use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of my coordinates.
  * Add the hotel name and the country in the hover message for each city on the map.

## Summary
Successfully performed API calls, querying, data modeling, and plot and map creations.
